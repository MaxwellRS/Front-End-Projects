  <h5 class="text-center">Career Bio</h5>
  <p> Brian Dawkins played 16 seasons for the Philadelphia Eagles, and then the Denver Broncos in the National Football League (NFL). He was widely considered one of the best to play at his position, and was an inspiration on and off the field. Dawkins was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2018, an honor that many thought was inevitable.
    Dawkins was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the 1996 NFL Draft, and he quickly found himself in the starting lineup of the defense. Over the years, he became renowned as one of the league's hardest hitting safeties, as well as an effective blitzer off the edge. He is currently on staff at the Philadelphia Eagles organization as a Football Operations Executive, in which he evaluates college-level NFL hopefuls.</p>
